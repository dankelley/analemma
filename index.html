<p>At the bottom of this webpage is an analemma diagram for Halifax, Nova
Scotia. The red rotated-infinity shape shows the position of the sun at local
noon, over the course of a year. The red dot shows the noontime value at the
day indicated in the top-right corner of the plot.  Also shown, in orange, is
the trace of the sun on that day, labelled by hours in a 24-hour clock.  All
times are in standard local time for Halifax, which is GMT minus 4 hours.</p>

<p>The centre of the diagram is the zenith, i.e. directly overhead. Rings
indicate the angle above the horizon. The outside of the diagram represents the
horizon, with North, etc. indicated, and dotted radial lines in 10-degree
increments.  North is at the top of the circle, East at the right-hand side,
etc.</p>

<p>The diagram is created with a <a
    href="analemma.php">script</a> written in the <a
    href="https://www.r-project.org">R programming language</a>. This script
is run daily at 2AM.</p>
